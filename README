About
This is a program written in Rust for manipulating Amiga ProTracker MOD-files.
I wrote this as an experiment trying to learn Rust.

The program can show various statistics about the file and extract the samples.
Future improvements will be the ability to replace samples and remove unused
patterns and unused samples.

Please feel free to report bugs and contribute in anyway you like.
